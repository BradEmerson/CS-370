**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

I was given the code for a game that involves a pirate searching for treasure; or on a broader scale, an agent that moves between spaces until it finds a reward space, then it wins the game.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists, at their core, focus on developing digital solutions (usually automation) to problems.  Often these digital solutions result in actual physical solutions, using complex or embedded systems that interact with the physical world (i.e., thermostats, pacemakers, robots, the list is nearly endless).

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

First, identify the problem.  One cannot solve a problem efficiently if it is improperly identified.  Think about potential solutions to the problem, and perform research.  Analyze the complexity of and viability of each solution.  Choose one, implement it.  Thoroughly test solution.  Adjust and repeat as necessary.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

Generally speaking, ethical responsibilities to the end user include making sure that the program operates within the stated scope only.  This should include principles such as encapsulation/compartmentalization, and secure programming in general to ensure that data remains protected.  Privacy is generally the root of all end user concerns when it comes to programming, but more broadly speaking, the program should not be capable of causing harm.  To ensure this, proper thorough testing is paramount prior to release. As far as the organization, speaking once again broadly, as this will vary depending on the end user and/or organization- proprietary data must be kept secure, along with access to other users' information.  It is the responsibility of the software engineer to ensure rigorous testing has occured prior to public (or even private) release of software.
